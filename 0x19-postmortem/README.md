# Postmortem Report:- API Service Outage Post-Mortem

## Issue Summary:

- **Duration:** The API service took an unexpected siesta from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM on May 10th, 2024 (UTC).
- **Impact:** 75% of users were left scratching their heads as the API service decided to take a coffee break, resulting in HTTP 500 errors for anyone trying to access it.

## Timeline:

- **10:00 AM:** Our monitoring system threw a tantrum, alerting us to the sudden influx of HTTP 500 errors.
- **10:05 AM:** The engineering team was rudely awakened from their peaceful slumber by the incessant buzzing of notifications.
- **10:20 AM:** We embarked on a wild goose chase, suspecting a grumpy database server was causing mischief.
- **11:00 AM:** Alas, the database servers were innocent bystanders in this fiasco.
- **11:30 AM:** After playing detective, we uncovered the true culpritâ€”a mischievous misconfiguration in the load balancer settings!
- **11:45 AM:** The DevOps team was called in to perform some much-needed load balancer therapy.
- **12:30 PM:** With the load balancer settings restored to their rightful state, peace was once again restored to the API kingdom.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

- **Root Cause:** Turns out, our load balancer was feeling rebellious and decided to play a little game of mix-up with incoming requests.
- **Resolution:** We promptly put the load balancer in its place, correcting the misconfiguration and restoring order to the API universe.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement automated load balancer behavior checks to keep it in line.
  - Enhance monitoring to catch any load balancer shenanigans before they escalate.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  1. Give the load balancer a stern talking-to and remind it of its responsibilities.
  2. Conduct regular load balancer therapy sessions to ensure it remains well-behaved.
  3. Update incident response protocols to include load balancer misbehaviors in the naughty list.
  4. Organize a team-building retreat to strengthen bonds and prevent future rebellions.

## Conclusion:

The unexpected API siesta on May 10th, 2024, provided us with a valuable lesson in load balancer management and the importance of staying vigilant. With our newfound knowledge and a little load balancer therapy, we're confident that our API service will remain happy and healthy for all users.
